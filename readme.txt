Be careful...

Now YOU are the master of your desktop's universe. Till yesterday you could create
anything on your desktop. But sometimes it showed some bad habits and didn't let
you remove what you created... Today, you can do ANYTHING !

You can send any object you don't like to the other side of the desktop's universe.
Just drop it on the Black Hole and it will disappear forever - and never come back
again.

Just kidding... But the truth is, you can delete ANYTHING. Unzip the file and run
BLACKHOLE.CMD. It will create an object on your desktop. This is it !

And don't try to delete your Desktop...   Enjoy ! Greg

Version 3:
                       ------------ Attention ! --------------
SOMFIX is required if you want to use this version !
This version allows you to delete an inactive Desktop. However, be warned that
I have experienced myself problems doing that. Removing objects from the inactive
desktop may cause standard (WPS) objects from the ACTIVE one to disappear.
There are users, which succesfully removed "spare" desktops without any problem.
Be careful !
This version also handles correctly any descendent classes and suppreses all of
the default WPS messages.

Version 2:
This version will resolve composite objects (folders) and eventually reset the
READ ONLY attribute... No mercy !
